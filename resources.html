		<h1>Getting Equipment</h1>

			<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GamesGaloreDirect/?fref=ts">Games Galore</a>: While there is a large variety of equipment for sale online through many retailers, Games Galore is a great option for sourcing your equipment locally. Even better is that they are generous enough to provide us with table space for hosting our club meetings each week, making it a great time to take a look at the equipment they have available or can possibly have ordered for you!</p>

			<p><a href="https://online-go.com/">Online Go Server (OGS)</a>: A browser based Go server that doesn't require any kind of desktop client to be installed. It has a very nice interface that is very easy to use. It even provides game review tools that allow for easy game analysis and after-game group reviewing.

			<p><a href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS Go Server</a>: An easy to use go server with a desktop client that doubles as an SGF editor (SGF's are the file type of saved games). Has a good user base of all play levels, making it good for players of any strength to play on.</p>
